#+title: live-crafter.el

This package provides automation for things I commonly do in videos and streams for the [[https://youtube.com/SystemCrafters][System Crafters YouTube channel]]:

- Starting video recording through OBS
- Starting background music playback and controlling fades with mpv.el
- Capturing timestamps for things that happen in the video like slide changes

it's probably a little too hard-coded to be useful to others at the moment but I might generalize it in the future if there's enough interest from others.
